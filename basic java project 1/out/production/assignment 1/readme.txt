Q1: For the question, it is needed to give float inputs in the format '3,4' not
the format '3.4'. The code is for converting the money from one unit to another.
There are 12 different conversions that can be done which are tl2usd, usd2tl,
tl2euro, euro2tl, euro2usd, usd2euro, gbt2tl, tl2gbp, euro2gbp, gbp2euro, gbp2usd,
and usd2gbp. There is also an input for exitting which is q. When it is run the
program, it asks the user to give an input as what it is wanted to convert. The
input should be one of the 13 possible inputs. If it is not, it asks the same
question again. After the right choice, it asks the unit value for the type that
is wanted to be transferred to. Then it will ask the user to give amount money in
the type that is wanted to be transferred from as an input. Finally, it will give
the converted value as an output.
