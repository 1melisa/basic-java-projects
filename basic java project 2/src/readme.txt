students. If the user wants to give information that less than the number of the students, the user needs to give -1 to
the id or the score. Duplicated data is not allowed. Characters to the name and lastname which are nonalphanumeric are
not allowed. No input to the lastname and name are also not allowed. If there is any, it will be given as an output that
what are the duplicates in the end. In the end, the data will be sorted first respect to the scores, then lastname and
finally the id. It will print the standard deviation, the mean and the median of the dataset.
